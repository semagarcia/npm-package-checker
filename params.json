If\r\nyou are publishing frontend components (not necessarily web components) in a repository (Nexus, Artifactory or even in npmjs repo), one\r\nstep before of that could be the check if the current version of its package.json has been upgraded correctly (useful when the policy is to\r\navoid override the same version; instead of that, the developer always have to increment, at least, the patch version).\r\n\r\nThat script, in a few words, will check if the version that you are trying to publish exists or not in the repo, stopping the process. The \r\nsteps to integrate it are:\r\n  1. Add \"Execute from the command line (shell)\" in the desired job.\r\n  2. Call the script directly (if it was installed globally) with specific params (in future versions this script could automatically search\r\n    the package.json in order to extract the version of the component).\r\n  3. Save and execute it!    \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Future features or improvements\r\nThat feature list will be populated with comments, suggestions and requests of the community.\r\n- [x] Initial version: check if a version has been released in a repo.\r\n- [ ] Search and extract automatically the version of package.json.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIf you are interested to contribute with that project, you could perform it via:\r\n- Opening an issue.\r\n- Pull Request.\r\n- Writing me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n",
